Caesar Cipher with Pi as Key

Each character of the input txt file is mapped to the digit of pi corresponding to that position. That digit of pi is then used as the key for that individual character when applying the Caesar Cipher.

Ouput files will appear in the same directory as either 'encoded.txt' or 'decoded.txt'.
